Enemies:
> Enemies are static agents with a field of view
> Allies pathfinding will factor in weights for tiles in the enemies line of sight

Vehicle:
> Planning Options:
>>> Move(Gridpos pos)
>>> DropOff(agent* a)
> Extends from agent class
> Make them take up 1x1 to start, later expand to larger grid size
> Move faster than regular agents
> We may be able to use proximity to wall as a factor for pathfinding with larger vehicles

Allies:
> Planning Options:
>>> Move(Gridpos pos)
>>> Board(Vehicle* v)
>>> Attack(Enemy* e)
>>> ThrowSmokeScreen(Gridpos pos)
> A radius around the smokescreen will turn values in the enemy vision layer to zero
